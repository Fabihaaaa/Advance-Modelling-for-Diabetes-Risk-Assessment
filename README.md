# Diabetes-Prediction
Objective: To classify patients into diabetic and non-diabetic classes

Required Libraries: 

1) numpy 
2) pandas 
3) matplotlib
4) seaborn
5) sklearn
6) XG Boost

Conclusion: 

• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the relationship between the variables, the 
underlying distribution of data and to deal with missing values
• Used Logistic Regression using SGD, Random Forest and AdaBoost model to predict
whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic
• Evaluated the model performance using error metrics 
• Observed ‘AdaBoost’ gave better output
